Some useful info from Atlassian SDK:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost

* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005

* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
				 
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
